Learn Python 2 - Python Syntax

Today I learned the basics of coding Python. What I did good on today's lesson was being able to code and understand very easiloy what to do. A thing I do need to work on, however, is using =+, I don't fully understand them yet but I am trying my best to understand how to use these. Other than that, the coding doesn't seem too hard at all. I need to learn when to use "" aswell, and I understand that Python2 and Python3 are different in that 2 uses "" and 3 uses (). I also learned that Python is one of the easiest and also one of the most used programming languages.

Learn Python 2 - Strings and Console Output

Today I better understood strings and how they worked. Strings specifically are defined by "" and to make an integer a string you can simply use things such as str() to make an integer a string. I also learned how to use .upper() and .lower(). A problem I am having, however, is that I don't know how to use len() or what it is speciically. I also have trouble with a specific problem in that section, where it was telling me to write MONTY(4). I need to work on  that problem and problem types like that specifically so next time I don't have trouble with those.

Learn Python 2 - Date and Time

Today I learned how to code time and date on Python 2. For the most part, its very easy and straightfoward. However, a problem I was facing was the %2d code. I had zero clue how they really worked / functioned and in general that gave me a somewhat hardtime. In general you use from datetime import datetime & now = datetime.now() to set up date and time. Overall  pretty straight forward.

Learn Python 2 - Conditionals and Control Flow

Today I learned about true/false statementsd aswell as "and" "or" & "else" statements. I learned more about booleans and in general I have a better understanding on how Python is able to make its own decisions using this code. A thing I was a bit confused about were elseif and not statements. I don't fully understand how they work and also sometimes the inequalities comfuse me aswell. Overall, I do have a good understanding on booleans and overal conditionals and flows but I still need some extra work on this particulat lesson

Learn Python 2 - Pyglatin

I learned how to create Pyglatin using Python 2, which simply is just rearanging and adding words. I had a difficult time with this lesson, mainly because the website was glithing a lot and in general wasn't really helping me with the lesson. I did have a lot of take aways though. I better understood the if statements. However i stil don't completelty understand the "len" statements too much. Also I couldn't test out my code because the website was glitching out too much for me to do anything. Im still happy I learned something however.
