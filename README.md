Learn Python 2 - Python Syntax

Today I learned the basics of coding Python. What I did good on today's lesson was being able to code and understand very easiloy what to do. A thing I do need to work on, however, is using =+, I don't fully understand them yet but I am trying my best to understand how to use these. Other than that, the coding doesn't seem too hard at all. I need to learn when to use "" aswell, and I understand that Python2 and Python3 are different in that 2 uses "" and 3 uses (). I also learned that Python is one of the easiest and also one of the most used programming languages.
