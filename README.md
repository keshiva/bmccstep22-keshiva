Learn Python 2 - Python Syntax

Today I learned the basics of coding Python. What I did good on today's lesson was being able to code and understand very easiloy what to do. A thing I do need to work on, however, is using =+, I don't fully understand them yet but I am trying my best to understand how to use these. Other than that, the coding doesn't seem too hard at all. I need to learn when to use "" aswell, and I understand that Python2 and Python3 are different in that 2 uses "" and 3 uses (). I also learned that Python is one of the easiest and also one of the most used programming languages.

Learn Python 2 - Strings and Console Output

Today I better understood strings and how they worked. Strings specifically are defined by "" and to make an integer a string you can simply use things such as str() to make an integer a string. I also learned how to use .upper() and .lower(). A problem I am having, however, is that I don't know how to use len() or what it is speciically. I also have trouble with a specific problem in that section, where it was telling me to write MONTY(4). I need to work on  that problem and problem types like that specifically so next time I don't have trouble with those.
